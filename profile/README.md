# Vorpal Authentication

Everything that you need to start developing in the Vorpal Authentication platform can be found in this github organization.



## Vorpal Libraries
These libraries make interacting with the Vorpal API easier and safer. We recommend using one of our libraries instead of your own implementation whenever possible.
Vorpal Libraries provide the strongest security level in the market.

 - Vorpal Extended Library [C, [C++](https://github.com/VorpalAuth/VorpalLibrary-CPP-Public)] [Coming soon...]
 - [Vorpal Library (Public)](https://github.com/VorpalAuth/VorpalLibrary-Public) [C++]

## Premade Vorpal API SDKs
These SDKs do some of the work for you, however they are nowhere as safe as the libraries either due to language limitations or other reasons.
Premade SDKs provide a similar security level to competing authentication systems.

## Vorpal REST API docs
You can also implement our API in any other language.
Check the docs out at [docs.vorpal.gg](https://docs.vorpal.gg), we also have a [OpenAPI Spec](https://github.com/VorpalAuth/Vorpal-OpenApiSpec) available.
